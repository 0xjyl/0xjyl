Security researcher and self-proclaimed terrible developer with a relentless curiosity about the intricate dance between offense and defense in the cyber realm. 
I find meaning in breaking things apart to deeply understand them‚Äîthen attempting to craft robust defenses to withstand tomorrow's threats. Inspired by Terry Davis's wisdom, I believe, "The purpose of life is to entertain God."
